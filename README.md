# CSElec01a-Group1
## Assignment Overview
The objective of this assignment is to investigate the law of large numbers and the "fairness" of various coins through empirical testing. By conducting thousands of controlled coin tosses, the study aims to determine if physical factors such as coin mass (Coin Class), surface friction (Wood vs. Tiles), and wear-and-tear (Old vs. New) introduce bias into what is theoretically a perfectly random event.

# FINDINGS
What I Found
1. It’s mostly 50/50, but not perfectly. Even after thousands of tosses, we ended up with 52.2% Heads and 47.8% Tails. It proves the "Law of Large Numbers". The more you toss, the closer it gets to even, but small biases still show up.
2. Surfaces change the game. Tiles gave way more "fair" results because the coin bounces and spins more. Wood is softer, so it "eats" the bounce, often making the coin stay on whatever side hit the floor first.
3. Old vs. New matters. New coins were almost perfect 50/50. Old coins were all over the place (one hit 59% Heads!). Basically, years of dirt and scratches actually mess with the coin's balance.
4. Big coins had the biggest swings. Because they’re heavy, they hit the floor harder and react more to whether it's Wood or Tile.
5. The "Class 2" Gap. Just a heads up: Class 2 was only tested on Wood. Since we don't have Tile data for it, we can't say for sure if it’s a biased coin or if the Wood surface just made it act that way.
